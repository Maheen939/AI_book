## 🎓 What You'll Learn

### Concepts
- ✅ Two-output philosophy (code + intelligence)
- ✅ Horizontal intelligence (ADRs, PHRs)
- ✅ Vertical intelligence (skills, subagents, tools)
- ✅ P+Q+P pattern for reusable components
- ✅ How Constitution cascades into all downstream work

### Commands
- ✅ `/sp.constitution` — Define standards
- ✅ `/sp.specify` — Write specs
- ✅ `/sp.clarify` — Refine specs
- ✅ `/sp.plan` — Create architecture
- ✅ `/sp.adr` — Document decisions
- ✅ `/sp.tasks` — Break into tasks
- ✅ `/sp.implement` — Execute with AI
- ✅ `/sp.phr` — Record sessions

### Skills
- ✅ How to write testable quality standards
- ✅ How to write SMART specifications
- ✅ How to identify and resolve ambiguities
- ✅ How to design architecture with tradeoff analysis
- ✅ How to decompose work into atomic units
- ✅ How to work collaboratively with AI
- ✅ How to design reusable components
- ✅ How to apply framework to existing projects

---

## ✨ Why This Matters

### For Your Textbook Project
- ✅ Formal, repeatable workflow (not ad-hoc)
- ✅ Documented decisions (ADRs explain "why")
- ✅ Captured sessions (PHRs show "what worked")
- ✅ Quality standards enforced (Constitution)
- ✅ Clear decomposition (Tasks)
- ✅ Intelligent collaboration (with AI)

### For Your Future Projects
- ✅ You'll complete projects 40-60% faster (Project 1 = baseline, Project 3 = 40% faster)
- ✅ You'll have documented reasoning (ADRs)
- ✅ You'll have proven prompts (PHRs)
- ✅ You'll have reusable components (Skills)
- ✅ You'll know exactly which phase you're in
- ✅ You'll be able to explain any decision

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Commit Early, Commit Often
- After each `/sp.X` command, commit results to git
- Creates audit trail of your thinking
- Enables rollback if needed

### Tip 2: Make Standards Testable
- ❌ "Papers should be well-written"
- ✅ "Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12; active voice 75%+"
- Vague standards = ambiguous execution

### Tip 3: Use "Try With AI" Prompts
Each lesson includes suggested AI prompts to validate your work. Use them!

### Tip 4: Review PHRs After Sessions
PHRs capture what prompts worked. Save them for future reference.

### Tip 5: Create Reusable Components When Patterns Emerge
After Phase 0, ask: "What patterns can I reuse in Phase 1?"

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I skip lessons?**
A: Not recommended. Lessons build on each other. Constitution must come before Specification, etc.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 4 weeks if you follow the timeline. Lesson 3-7 take ~2 weeks, Lesson 8 takes ~1 week.

**Q: Do I need to use all the slash commands?**
A: Yes. The workflow teaches you mastery of `/sp.constitution`, `/sp.specify`, `/sp.clarify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`, `/sp.adr`, `/sp.phr`.

**Q: Can I apply this to other projects?**
A: Yes! That's Lesson 10-11 (Brownfield Adoption). The workflow is universal.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Each lesson has "Try With AI" prompts. Use them to validate your work and get unstuck.

**Q: Will I have a certificate?**
A: No official certificate, but completing the quiz validates mastery. You'll have a portfolio of artifacts (Constitution, Spec, Plan, Tasks, ADRs, PHRs).
