# Docusaurus setup (local)

This repository includes a minimal Docusaurus scaffold. Follow these steps to run locally on Windows (PowerShell):

1. Ensure you have Node.js (>=16) and npm installed.
2. From the project root (`D:\agentic ai\Ai textbook`), install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm start
```

4. Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Notes:
- If you prefer Yarn: `yarn` then `yarn start`.
- The docs are in `docs/`. The larger specification files under `specs/` can be linked from docs or copied into `docs/` where needed.
